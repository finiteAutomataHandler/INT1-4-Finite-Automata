# INT1-4-Finite-Automata

Operations on Finite Automata

Your program is divided into several stages:

1. Reading a FA that you should first code in a text file, then storing that
information in memory and displaying it on the screen.
2. Displaying other types of information: is the FA deterministic? deterministic
and complete? standard?
3. If the FA is not standard, standardizing it on demand.
4. If the FA is not complete deterministic, obtaining an equivalent complete
deterministic FA.
5. Calculating the equivalent minimal FA.
6. Testing word recognition.
7. Creating an automaton recognizing the complementary language and testing
word recognition on that automaton.
